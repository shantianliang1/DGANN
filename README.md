# Few-Shot Image Classification via Double-Ended Graph Augmentation Neural Networks
Implementation of DGANN on Python3.8, Pytorch1.12.0

## key algorithms
Our algorithm first uses image data to process the dataset, which can be found in the 'DataAugmentation' folder. Then, it performs image classification tasks and simultaneously enhances data features, which can be found in the 'DataAugmentation', 'DatasetChoose' folders, and 'train.py' . Our model is located in the Model folder and includes the backbone and GNN-model.



1. please download the dataset miniImageNet/cifar-fs like the form of （train/val/test// CSV.）
2. please begin the first data generation
3. train
